  and madness. None of us thought that advancement in technology would lead to a catastrophe like cyberpsychosis, rather all of us celebrated
  the innovations. We all had lost our hopes, but not the brilliant minds of Shankhin Sharma, Puru Priyamvad Verma, Hariaksh Maggo, Kenneth Gomes
  and Tejinder Singh of St Columba's. With the help of their ever lasting expertise and knowledge, they have developed the SPHKT chair,
  a treatment and cure to all of our main misery. Using this SPHKT chair, we can once again go back to the sunny and happy days that 
  we remember each and every day.</div>

  <h3 text-align="center" ><b><u> OUR PRODUCT "THE SPHKT CHAIR"</u></b></h3>
  <div id="product"> During the apocalypse and cyberpsychosis, the SPHKT team developed a chair. When a person sits on the chair, he attaches the usbs on himself. Those usbs act and deactivate the chips. After this, the chair encloses in a room and auto surgery is performed on the person to remove the chips entirely, after which he becomes a normal man.
 This chair has helped save a lot of lives in the city of Navi Mumbai . It is free of cost , the purpose is to 
 not to earn profit but to help people and save their lives . It is  easily accessible to those who might need it
and designed to be very friendly to sit , be able to work continuously for long durations of time , be durable and support heavy weights .
